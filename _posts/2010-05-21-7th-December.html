The future of web development? (<a class="externallink" href="http://nodejs.org/" title="node.js" target="_blank">node.js</a>)</b><br>
We also discussed Unit Test using (<a class="externallink" href="http://www.junit.org/" title="jUnit" target="_blank">jUnit</a>) and the use of (<a class="externallink" href="http://jlint.sourceforge.net//" title="jLint" target="_blank">jLint</a>) for code analysis<br><br>9 <b>C#5 Thoughts</b><br>
There's a great series of posts by Eric Lippert <a class="externallink" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2010/10/28/asynchrony-in-c-5-part-one.aspx" title="here" target="_blank">here</a> on the new async features.<br><br>8 <b>Alternative web frameworks? <a class="externallink" href="http://elegantcode.com/2010/11/28/introducing-nancy-a-lightweight-web-framework-inspired-by-sinatra/" title="Nancy" target="_blank">Nancy</a>, <a class="externallink" href="http://jacksonh.tumblr.com/post/1159500924/manos-de-mono-the-manifesto" title="Manos" target="_blank">Manos</a>, <a class="externallink" href="http://www.paracode.com/blog/2010/12/introducing-nina-the-friendly-web-microframework-that-performs/" title="Nina" target="_blank">Nina</a>.</b><br><br>9 <b>Why NoSQL?</b><br><br>7 <b>Building objects with context. How do you protect your constructors?</b><br><br>7 <b>Outsourcing to India/China - pros and cons?</b><br><br>7 <b>What will you be doing in five years time?</b><br>
This was very interesting. Almost no one wanted to be working as an employee in 5 years time. Contracting is seen as a better alternative in most cases, but the real geek dream seems to be to run your own product company.<br><br>Stuff we didn't have time for:<br><br>7 <b>NuGet - anyone used it / alternatives?</b><br><br>6 <b>How do you structure large scale Javascript applications? / Are there alternatives to Javascript on the browser?</b><br><br>6 <b>Method parameter validation - what do you use? Code contracts? Validation library? Other?</b><br><br>4 <b>"My friend is starting a business and wants a simple website he can content manage himself." What's the simplest / quickest / cheapest way to do this?</b><br><br>3 <b>How well do you know your DB platform?</b><br><br>2 <b>Is Google Wave useful?</b>
