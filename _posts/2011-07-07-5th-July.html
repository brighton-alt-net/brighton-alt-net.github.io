		<b>1 Anyone use BDD/Agile Acceptance Testing</b><br><br>This got answered by a web dev who was first time coming to our meetings,. He uses Cucumber and WaitIn to write scripting tests at the Web UI level. For him, There is no involvement from BAs or Testers and he found that disappointing. Some people recommended tools they had tried MSpec/specFlow/Fitnesse. There was a discussion on the difference between unit testing and BDD – BDD being a high level test  that gets Business non-dev people involved in the discussion. The thought was they should cover the important business cases and should exercise code below the UI level in order to stop them being brittle.<br><br><b>2 How to Introduce TDD to a company</b><br><br><ul><li>I think the following answers were quite helpful (apart from one):</li><li>Learn by example</li><li>Wave a big stick and hit any developer who forgets or refuses  to do TDD</li><li>Sit with developers,especially targeting experienced/non-experienced or communicative types</li><li>Pair programming</li><li>Sit with 2 developers who need to learn TDD either side of a developer who knows it, so they can discuss in a group</li><li>Looking at code coverage</li><li>Integrate into CI build<br></li></ul><br><b>3 How to cope with large amount of technical debt (another question was asked along similar lines by someone later)</b><br><br><ul><li>Prioritise</li><li>Focus on the most important business cases first</li><li>TDD</li><li>Code reviews</li><li>Pair Programming</li><li>Rewrite or wrap in tests and refactor (between us we didn’t really resolve this argument)<br></li></ul><br>If you were there and I’ve forgotten anything or got something wrong please say!
