		This month's session is part of Brighton Digital Festival. Rather than our regular semi-organised open conference format, we are holding a show-and-tell evening. This is a series of short, 20 minute, talks by our members. The lineup is as follows:<br><br><b>Kim Richmond</b>: Graph Databases in Neo4J<br><br>Graph databases allow us to store and represent data along with relationships which we can then explore. I'll be giving you a tour of Neo4J and demonstrating some of the powerful features of graph databases and seeing how you can use them to power applications.<br><br><b>David Arno</b>: Code Club<br><br>What is Code club? Why is it important to teach kids to program? And how can you get involved? I'll give a whistle-stop tour of the philosophy of Code Club, the Scratch programming language and offer advice on setting up your own club at a local primary school.<br><br><b>Anthony Johnston</b>: <a class="externallink" href="http://myxi.co" title="myXI.co" target="_blank">myXI.co</a>, a team editor.<br><br>28.7 million people worldwide now follow football clubs on Twitter<br><br>Ronaldo has more than 20 million twitter followers and 60 million facebook friends<br><br>.. but who cares, this is about an app which fully describes its state in an enormous URL, which can be posted on social networks - no database required<br><br><b>Mike Hadlow</b>: <a class="externallink" href="http://socsnap.com" title="SocSnap" target="_blank">SocSnap</a>, A Raspberry Pi and Twitter based social photo device.<br><br>This little project is a way to bring people together at an event, or at a particular geographic location. SocSnap will be set up all evening, so there will be plenty of time to have a hands-on play with it. The talk will describe what it's intended to do, how it was put together, and some lessons learnt from developing a kiosk style device for the Raspberry Pi.
