		We really didn't rush this time, only got though four questions. Numbers are the number of votes that each topic got.<br><br>12. <b>Windows 8. End of the line for WPF / SL?</b><br><br>12. <b>Design Patterns. Which do you use? Which are now anti-patterns</b><br>
We spent a lot of time talking about this, going through a list of the GoF patterns and discussing each one in turn.<br><br>12. <b>When, and when not, to use the Repository Pattern?</b><br><br>9. <b>Which features would you ask Erich Gamma to add to a future version of Visual Studio?</b><br>
Seemed to be a general consensus that VS is slow and bloated. Although a lot of the discussion was on how Resharper slows things down.<br><br>What we didn't have time for.<br><br>8. <b>Does open source reduce the opportunity to make a living from software development?</b><br><br>7. <b>Does anyone have any advice regarding agile's use in their workplace?</b><br><br>7. <b>.NET is good. C# is great. Why is WPF so bloody awful? And Winforms?</b><br><br>7. <b>Beyond TDD. Experience with BDD? Any thoughts?</b><br><br>6. <b>Making Lambdas easy for non-.NET people.</b><br><br>6. <b>How do you do parsing?</b><br><br>4. <b>Anyone used RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ, AMQP?</b><br><br>1. <b>WWF 4.0?</b><br><br>1. <b>Has unit testing had its day?</b> <br><br><a class="externallink" href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/markrussinovich/archive/2008/07/21/3092070.aspx" title="Memory stuff" target="_blank">Memory stuff</a>
