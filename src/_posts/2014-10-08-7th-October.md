It covered homebrew, Microsoft's acquisition of Minecraft, Vim and the upcoming mono linux ultra high performance server.<br><br>How to add a CI process on to GitHhub checkins?<br><br><h2 class="separator">IIS vs Self hosted?<a class="headeranchor" id="IIS_vs_Self_hosted_2" href="#IIS_vs_Self_hosted_2" title="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2>
IIS offers a range of services - if these are useful to you then it can make sense to use IIS. Some examples are the built in facility for monitoring and recycling applications, URL rewriting and authentication handling.<br><br>A number of standard operations management platforms (not just Microsoft's own Systems Center Operation Manager suite) offer rich functionality for managing and deploying IIS applications. There's also Azure's native support. If you self-host you are on your own here.<br><br>Another key point is that IIS runs pretty close to the metal these days, and in either case you are using the kernel mode http.sys drivers - so self host is not guaranteed to be faster than IIS, it depends on what you are doing. <br><br>One reason not to use IIS would be if you didn't want to use Windows at all.<br><br>Another is that sticking to self-hosted options and avoiding an IIS dependency can make testing easier to manage - although with the advent of IIS Express, Owin and Powershell this is far less of a problem than it used to be.<br><br>
